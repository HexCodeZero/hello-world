# hello-world

The future ain't what it used to be.
One day your parents picked you up, sat you down, and never picked you up again.
The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.
At the end of the game, the king and the pawn go back in the same box.
Give a man a mask and he will show you his true face.
We all make choices. But in the end, our choices make us.
